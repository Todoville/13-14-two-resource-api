## Code
This code is an API where you can add characters to a database and update their special movelist and the properties of those moves. The Character needs a name and a boolean of "Charge", where you tell us if the character is a charge type character (EG Guile or M.Bison) or not (EG Ryu and Ken). The Special Moves take in a name and a move style (EG Command Grab or Reversal). Have fun logging your favorite 2D fighters!!
